/*Question description
There is a classroom which has M rows of benches in it. Also, N students will arrive one-by-one and take a seat.
Every student has a preferred row number(rows are numbered 1 to M and all rows have a maximum capacity K. Now, the students come one by one starting from 1 to N  and follow these rules for seating arrangements:
Every student will sit in his/her preferred row(if the row is not full).
If the preferred row is fully occupied, the student will sit in the next vacant row. (Next row for N will be 1)
If all the seats are occupied, the student will not be able to sit anywhere.*/
