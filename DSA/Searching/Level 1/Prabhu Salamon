/*Problem Description:
Prabhu Salamon is planning to make a very long journey across the cityside by Train. His journey consists of N train routes, numbered from 1 to N in the order he must take them. The trains themselves are very fast, but do not run often. The i-th train route only runs every Xi days.*/
