/*Problem Description:
In mathematics, a permutation of a set is, loosely speaking, an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order, or it the set is already ordered, a rearrangement of its elements. The word
"permutation" also reters to the act or process ot changing the linear order ot an ordered set.
Mariappan(M) is alone too and has a permutation pl,p2,...pn of numbers from I to n.
M thinks that a permutation pl,p2,..pn beautifulness is detined as value of E | pi-i|, I<=i<=n.
M can swap two elements of the permutation at most once.*/
