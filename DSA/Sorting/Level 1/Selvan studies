/*Question description
Selvan studies, engineering as per his father's wishes, while Aaron, whose family is poor, studies engineering to improve his family's financial situation. sumanth, however, studies engineering of his
simple passion for developing data structure applicaions.
sumanth is participating in a hackathon for data structure application development.
sumanth task is to use lnsertion Sot to sort the supplied set of numbers.
As a result, The input provides the number of components on the first line and the numbers to be sorted on the second line. Print the array's state at the third iteration and the final sorted array in the
supplied tormat in the output.
Judge will determine whether the outcome is correct or not.*/
