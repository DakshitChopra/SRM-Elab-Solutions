Question description
Dr.Siva jayaprakash is a faculty, who handling data structure course for IT department second year students.
one day this facully was handling very interesting topic in data structure such that linked list, he has given the following explanation for linked list concept.
"Linked list is a sequence of links which contains items. Each link contains a connection to another link. Linked list is the second mostused data structure after array. Following are the important terms to
understand the concept of Linked List.
Link - Each link of a linked list can store a data called an element.
Next- Each link of a linked list contains a link to the next link called Next.
Linkedlist-A Linked List contains the connection link to the first link called First."
During this lecture time, principal surprisingly visited to the class and asking to conduct surprise test on Linked list concept.
So the faculy decided to conduct test on the topic of linked list.
the question was given to last bench students that is,
The nodes are deleted D times from the end of the given linked list.
For example if the given Linked list is 5>10Â»15>20>25 and remove 2 nodes,
then the Linked Llist becomes 5>10>15.*/

tt -> data = a;
p1 -> next = tt;
p1=p1->next;

p1 -> next = NULL;

if(found) break; }
cout<<"Linked List:";
