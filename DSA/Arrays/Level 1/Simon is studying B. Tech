/*Question description
Simon is studying B. Tech.-Mechanical Engineering.
He's going to atfend a computer science-based subject exam this semester.
Due to the less preparation in the previous monthly tests, his internal mark decreased.
His computer science Protessor made an ofter one more chance to boost up his internal marks.
Professor assigns a program to Simon for the internal mark bootup.
So Simon wants to solve Questions which is given by the test coordinator.
the question was, two integer arrays numsl and nums2 sorted in ascending order and an integer k.
Detine a pair (u,v) which consists of one element from the first array and one element from the second array.
Simon need to identily the k pairs (ul,vl),(u2,v2)..(uk,vk) with the smallest sums.*/
