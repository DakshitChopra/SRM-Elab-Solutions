/*Question description
Simon is studying B.Tech.Mechanical Engineering.
He's going to attend a computer science-based subject exam this semester.
Due to the less preparation in the previous monthly tests, his internal mark decreased.
His computer science Protessor made an otfer one more chance to boost up his internal marks.
Professor assigns a program to Simon for the internal mark boostup.
So Simon wants to identihy the element of array which occurs most time in the array
Can you help him ?*/
