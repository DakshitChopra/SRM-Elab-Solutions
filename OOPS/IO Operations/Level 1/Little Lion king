/*Problem Description:
A Little Lion king and his friends from the Zoo like candies very much.
There are N lions in the Zoo. 
The lion with number K (1 ≤ K ≤ N) will be happy if he receives at least AK candies. 
Overall there are C candies in the Zoo.
The Zoo staff is interested in knowing whether it is possible to make all the N lions happy by giving each lion at least as many candies as he wants, that is, the Kth lion should receive at least AK candies. 
Each candy can be given to only one lion. 
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ N ≤ 100
1 ≤ C ≤ 10^9
1 ≤ AK ≤ 10000, for K = 1, 2, ..., N
Input Format:
The first line of the input file contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. Each test case consists of exactly 2 lines. The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N and C, the total number of lions and the total number of candies in the Zoo respectively. 
The second line contains N space separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN.
Output Format:
Print the output exactly one line containing the string "Yes" if it possible to make all lions happy and the string "No" otherwise. 
Output is case sensitive. So do not print 'YES' or 'yes'.*/
