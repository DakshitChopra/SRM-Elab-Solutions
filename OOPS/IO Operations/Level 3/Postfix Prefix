/*Problem Description
Maran the head of data verification division of the popular Data Analytics company is responsible for verification of predicted change in data values based on some pattern from its initial value provided to him.
Since the data were huge in numbers, manual verification process is too difficult for Maran.
The expected data value pattern is as follows:
Decrement of First Number and Increment of Second Number
Increment of First Number and Decrement of Second Number
Decrement of First Number and Increment of Second Number
Increment of First Number and Decrement of Second Number
Decrement of First Number and Increment of Second Number
Function Description
Use postfix mode for firstnum 
Use prefix mode for secondnum
Constraints
1≤firstnum≤500
1≤secondnum≤500
Input Format:
Only line of Input has two integers separated by a space representing the value of firstnum and secondnum respectively.
Output Format:
Print the Output by performing the expected operation in the expected pattern.*/

#include <bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int firstnum,secondnum;
    
    cin>>firstnum>>secondnum;
    
    cout<<firstnum--<<" "<<++secondnum<<endl;
    cout<<firstnum++<<" "<<--secondnum<<endl;
    cout<<firstnum--<<" " <<++secondnum<<endl;
    cout<<firstnum++<<" "<<--secondnum<<endl;
    cout<<firstnum<<" "<<++secondnum<<endl;

	return 0;
}
