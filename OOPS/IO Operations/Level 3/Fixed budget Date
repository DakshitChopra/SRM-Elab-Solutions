/*Problem Description
Karthik  asks Jessi for a date .
But Karthik is a hardworking guy and has a value for money so he already pre-planned about his date and fixed a budget to spend from his savings .
Given a fixed budget B and an array A[ ] of size N for the amount of N expenses .
You have to calculate the total amount and check whether the date costs him beyond his fixed budget . 
If the total amount goes beyond budget then print “YES” otherwise “NO” .
Constraints:
1≤T≤100
1≤N≤10 power 4
1≤A[i]≤10 power 4
Input Format:
First line will contain T, number of testcases. Then T testcases follow.
First line of each testcase contains of a single line of input, two integers N,B.
Second line of each testcase contains N integers A[0],A[1],...,A[N−1] separated by a single space.
Output Format:
For each testcase, output in a single line answer YES or NO .*/
