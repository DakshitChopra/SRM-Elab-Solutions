/*Problem Description:
Swathy and Nancy were selected for SpaceY programme which was about to take place the next year ,in their interview they were struck with the question.
The question is that if the floating number is given they have to create a code to display the rightmost integer from the integer part of the number.
If they have the logic for the code they will be the part of the digital meter designing for the SpaceY Mars launch which was their dream.
Can you help them with a logic of the code for the criteria given to them?
Constraints:
25.0000 â‰¤ spacenum < 999.0000
Input Format: 
Only Line of Input has single value of type float.
Output Format: 
Print the rightmost integer from the input value.
Explanation : 
If the input is given 124.34, then the output to be displayed is 4 (i.e) Before decimal the integral part is 124 , in that last digit is 4.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    float spacenum;
    int b,digit;
    cin>>spacenum;
    b=spacenum;
    digit=b%10;
    cout<<digit;
	return 0;}
