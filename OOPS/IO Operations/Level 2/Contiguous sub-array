/*Problem Description:
Vimal's father gave him an array of N numbers and gave him a task.
Vimal's task is, he need find the contiguous sub-array with maximum sum if he want to get a new mobile phone as a reward.
But vimal is finding it difficult to complete the task.
Can you help him for competing his task so that he will a new mobile phone as a reward.
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 110
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
-107 ≤ A[i] <= 107
Input Format:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of array.  
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the elements of the array.
Output Format:
Print the maximum sum of the contiguous sub-array in a separate line for each test case.*/
