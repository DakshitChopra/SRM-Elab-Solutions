/*Problem Description:
Malina has an alphanumeric string made up of digits and lower case Latin characters only.Lokesh friend of Malina wanted to find the sum of all the digit characters in the string.
Can you help him finding it?
Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
1 ≤ |S| ≤ 1000, where |S| is the length of the string S.
Input Format:
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
Each test case is described with a single line containing a string S, the alphanumeric string.
Output Format:
Print the output in a single line containing the sum of all the digit characters in that string.*/

#include <iostream>
#include <cstring>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    char s[10001];
    int t;
    cin>>t;
    while(t--){
    cin>>s;
    int sum=0;
    int w=strlen(s);
    for(int i=0;i<w;i++){
        if(s[i]>='0' && s[i]<='9')
        sum+=s[i]-'0';
    }
    cout<<sum<<endl;
    }
	return 0;
