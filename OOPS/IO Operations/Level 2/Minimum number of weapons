/*Problem Description:
2022 was approaching and the world was about to end. So 2 gods Shiva and Jesus created the Cyberverse.
But this time disappointed with humans both the gods decided not to have humans in this world. 
So they created a world of cyborgs. 
A world without humans. Isn’t it interesting? So let us dive into the cyberverse and have a look at their problems.
There are N kid cyborgs with Chief Cyborg '100gods' and he has K weapons with him. 
He wants to distribute those K weapons among N kid cyborgs. 
Since all the kid cyborgs are very good friends, so they set a rule among themselves for taking those weapons. 
The rule states that the difference between kid cyborg having the maximum weapons and the kid cyborg having minimum weapons should be less than or equal to 1.
Find the value of the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg can have when all the K weapons are distributed among them.
Constraints:
1≤N≤500
1≤K≤1000
Input Format:
Only line of input will contain two space-separated integers denoting N and K respectively.
Output Format:
Output a single line containing an integer X denoting the minimum number of weapons a kid cyborg can have in that test case.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main()
{
    int n,k,weapons;
    cin>>n>>k;
    weapons=k/n;
    cout<<weapons;
	return 0;
}
