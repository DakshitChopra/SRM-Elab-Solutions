Rohit usually plays smart in most of the times and wins the bet.
Johit who is on the loosing side on most of the occasions loves to Win and waiting for yet another challenge from Rohit
Finally the day has arrived and Rohit once again smartly given the challenging task on Time based problem knowing that Johit was not so good in in
Johit was given a string time in the form of hh:mm, where some of the digits in the string are hidden (represented by ?).
Now Rohit asked Johit to print the the latest valid time he can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.
Johit is once again on Pressure of Winning, can you help Johit for Winning his first challenge against his friend ?
Function Description
The valid times are those inclusively between 00:00 and 23:59.
Constraints:
time is in the format hh:mm.
It is guaranteed that you can produce a valid time from the given string.
Input Format:
Only line of input has a time in the format hh:mm with ? on it representing the hidden digits in the time.
Output Format:
In the only line of output print the latest valid time he can get from time by replacing the hidden digits.
Explanation:
Assume Input Time = 2?:?0
Here the latest hour beginning with the digit '2' is 23 and the latest minute ending with the digit '0' is 50.
So Output Time = 23:50*/
