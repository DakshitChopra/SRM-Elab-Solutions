/*Problem Description:
Athithya Karihalan the Chola King has a hobby of learning about building architectures and its construction methodologies throughout India.
Imagine he has given you the task of analyzing the building parameters and find the stability of the building. 
Can you complete the prestigious task assigned to you ??  
Functional Description:
Athithya Karihalan is interested in Buildings that are almost in the shape of a square. 
If the length and width of the building differ by at most 10, then the building is suitable. 
If the difference between the length and width of the building is more than 10, then it is not suitable. 
Constraints:
20≤length≤500
40≤width≤400
20≤ratePerSqFeet≤1000
Input Format:
Only line of input has three integer values separated by a space representing length, width and ratePerSqFeet respectively.
Output Format:
In the First line of output print the cost of building.
In the Second line of output print if the building is Suitability of building */
