/*Question description
Zaheer needs a fence around his farm, but he is too lazy to build it himself. 
So he purchased a fence building robot.
He wants the fence to be a regular polygon. 
The robot builds the fence along a single path, but it can only make fence corners at a single angle a.
Will the robot be able to build the fence Zaheer wants? 
Constraints:
0 < t < 200
0 < a < 180
The first line of input contains an integer t () — the number of tests. 
Each of the following t lines contains a single integer a () representing the angle the robot can make corners at measured in degrees.
Output Format:
For each test, output on a single line "YES" (without quotes), if the robot can build a fence Emuskald wants, and "NO" (without quotes), if it is impossible.*/

        {
            cout<<"YES"<<endl;

        }
        else{
            cout<<"NO"<<endl;
