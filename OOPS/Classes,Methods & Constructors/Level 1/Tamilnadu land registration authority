/*Problem Description:
Tamilnadu land registration authority is panning to keep track of the native addresses and total area of the flats people have across the state.
Since the total population and area need to be monitored is huge. Government is looking for the software which does this task.
Can you help them with proper programming logic for implementing the same?
Constraints:
1≤ hno ≤500
1≤ no_rooms ≤ 10
1≤ length ≤ 50
1≤ breadth ≤ 50
1≤ height ≤ 50
Input Format:
The first line of the input contain a single string denoting the house name.
The second line of the input contain three values of type Integer String and String separated by a space representing house number, city and state respectively.
The third line of the input has a single integer representing the number of rooms.
The subsequent lines of input must have length, breadth and height of each room
Output Format:
Print the details of the house in the expected format.*/
