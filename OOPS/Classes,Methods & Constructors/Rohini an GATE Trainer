/*Problem Description:
Rohini an GATE Trainer. During his preparation for tomorrow's session on Number Systems.
She thought of giving the task on creating a programming logic for the following case for her students:
Function Description:
Assume integer n (in base 10) and a base k is provided to you.
Now Your task is to print sum of the digits of n after converting n from base 10 to base k.
After converting, each digit should be interpreted as a base 10 number, and the sum should be returned in base 10.
Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 500
2 ≤ k ≤ 10
Input Format:
Only Line of Input has two values of type integer separated by a space representing n and k respectively.
Output Format:
In the only line of output print the desired result.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class ChangeBase{
public:
    void sumBase(int n,int k) {
        int ans = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            ans += n % k;
            n /= k;
        }
       cout<<ans;
    }
};
int main(){
int n=0,k=0;
cin>>n>>k;
ChangeBase Convert;
Convert.sumBase(n,k);

	return 0;
}
