Question description:
A lot of people in Finland hates rain, but Romi do not. 
Rain pacifies, puts Romi thoughts in order. By these years Romi have developed a good tradition — when it rains, Romi go on the street and stay silent for a moment, contemplate all around her, enjoy freshness, think about big deeds she have to do.
Today everything had changed quietly. Romi went on the street with a cup contained water, her favorite drink. 
In a moment when Romi were drinking a water she noticed that the process became quite long: the cup still contained water because of rain. 
She decided to make a formal model of what was happening and to find if it was possible to drink all water in that situation.
Thus, Romi cup is a cylinder with diameter equals d centimeters. 
Initial level of water in cup equals h centimeters from the bottom.
Romi drink a water with a speed equals v milliliters per second. But rain goes with such speed that if she do not drink a water from the cup, the level of water increases on e centimeters per second. 
The process of drinking water from the cup and the addition of rain to the cup goes evenly and continuously.
Find the time needed to make the cup empty or find that it will never happen. 
It is guaranteed that if it is possible to drink all water, it will happen not later than after 10^4  seconds.
Note one milliliter equals to one cubic centimeter.
Constraints:
1 ≤ d, h, v, e ≤ 10^4
Input Format:
The only line of the input contains four integer numbers d, h, v, e, where:
 d — the diameter of your cylindrical cup,
 h — the initial level of water in the cup,
 v — the speed of drinking process from the cup in milliliters per second,
 e — the growth of water because of rain if you do not drink from the cup.
 Output Format:
 If it is impossible to make the cup empty, print "NO" (without quotes).Otherwise print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. 
 In the second line print a real number — time in seconds needed the cup will be empty. 
 The answer will be considered correct if its relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10^-4.
 It is guaranteed that if the answer exists, it doesn't exceed 10^4.*/
