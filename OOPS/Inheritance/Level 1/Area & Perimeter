/*Question description:
Pallavi is an Construction Engineer. 
During her Site Supervision she used to calculate the area and perimeter of different parts of the site and update in her design book.
But it often leads to confusion while instructing the construction workers the construction plan.
So to avoid confusion she is looking for the automated measurement tool.
So she will be happy if you can help her with such as tool
Can you do it?
Constraints:
100≤length≤5000
100≤breadth≤5000 
Input Format:
Only line of input has a two value of type integer representing length and breadth measurements respectively.
Output format:
Print the area and perimeter in a separate lines respectively based on the measurements provided by Pallavi*/
