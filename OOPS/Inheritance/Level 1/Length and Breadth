Priya is an architect. During her designing process she used to note down lot of length and breath details in her Design notebook.
But it often leads to confusion.So to avoid confusion she decided to keep track of all her measurement digital.
So she will be happy if you can help her with the logic which can get the measurements from here and display in the formatted manner.
Can you do it?
Constraints:
100≤length≤5000
100≤breadth≤5000
Input Format:
Only line of input has a two value of type integer representing length and breadth measurements respectively.
Output format:
Print the details in the formatted manner.*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
class ReceiveMesurement{};
class FormatMesurement : public ReceiveMesurement{
    public:void display(){
        int l,b;
        cin>>l>>b;
        cout<<"Length:"<<l<<" metres"<<endl;
        cout<<"Breadth:"<<b<<" metres";
    }
};
int main()
{
    FormatMesurement mt;
    mt.display();
	return 0;
