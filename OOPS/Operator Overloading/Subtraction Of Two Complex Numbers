/*Question description
The math assignment of the weekend is that subtraction of two complex numbers. Raja need to verify his work. Can you help him to find the answer? 
Input Format
First line represent the real part and imaginary part of the complex number separated by a space
Second line represent  the real part and imaginary part of the complex number separated by a space
Output Format
Print the complex form of given numbers in the first and second line of the output and then the third line will be the result.*/
